## General Info
Puzzle Arcadia is a game arcade featuring three classic games: Hangman, 2048, and an open-source Sudoku game. This site is catered towards children and to challenge themselves with a variety of puzzles, testing their problem-solving skills.

## Reflection
Creating Puzzle Arcadia presented several challenges, including:
- Implementing an open-source game to match the style of the other two games.
- Learning JavaScript to develop game functionalities and interactivity.
- Balancing game difficulty and user experience to ensure an enjoyable gameplay experience for players of all ages.

Developing the Hangman game posed specific challenges:
- **Game Logic**: Designing algorithms to handle player guesses, manage correct and incorrect guesses, and update the game display accordingly.
- **User Interface**: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface that guides players through the game while maintaining suspense and excitement.

Similarly, creating the 2048 game presented its own set of difficulties:
- **Tile Grid Logic**: Implementing the logic for generating and managing the tile grid, including tile merging and movement mechanics.
- **Swipe Detection**: Developing algorithms to detect swipe gestures on both desktop and mobile devices, translating them into game actions and points.
